# building_die

This is a small project I did in my "Intermediate Course" on DataCamp

Here's the problem:
I am in a building and I am going to throw a die. 
If it lands on 1 or 2, I will go one step down.
If it lands on 3 or 4, I will go one step up.
If it lands on 6, I will throw the die again. The new number will be the amout of steps that I will go up.
Other rules, I can't go below step 0 and there's a 0,1% chance that I will fall down the stairs every time I move. I will therefore have to restart at step 0 again.

THE GOAL: I think that after 500 throws, I will be above step 60. What are the probability that I am right ?

I will write a program to answer this question. It will get me familiar with the library NumPy as well as matplotlib.pyplot
